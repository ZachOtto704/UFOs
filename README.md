# UFOs

Overview of Project:

The purpose of this analysis is to display data collected of UFO sightings on one concise webpage, with the ability to filter the data based on date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. Being able to organize the data in this way allows the reader to create their own filters so they can search for any commonalities or trends in the UFO data, hopefully allowing them to make an assumption about what the UFOs are or why they are in certain places at certain times. 


Results:

One can query the data using the search criteria, using the website filters. For example, In order to see data entries from North Carolina, the user would simply type "nc" in the state filter.

Here, only data entries from NC are shown. If one was looking for a more specific search that occured on January 5th 2010 in North Carolina, the user could add "1/5/2010" to the date filter while keeping the state:

Any other combination of search criteria will work, and display any data entries there are for what is specified.


Summary:

This new design is far superior from the old one, as the data entries can be queried by more filters than Date alone. One drawback is that queries must be entered exactly in order to get results. For example, a date query of "01/05/2010" would not work while "1/5/2010" would. One recommendation would be to allow the datetime to be more maluable. The site could also benefit from giving a list of common "shape" queries, as one might not know what shapes are common to look for.
